Currently this is just a server that can proxy all content
from any website through a single origin, cache it for offline use,
and allow users to activate the X-Ray Goggles on any page.

It's the beginning of a more wide-ranging experiment in offline
webmaking, though.

## Quick Start

```
npm install
node app.js
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

## Use cases

* Configured as a browser's proxy server for accessing
  offline content.
* Accessing all content in a webpage via a single, unrestricted
  origin (bypassing same-origin security restrictions,
  `X-Frame-Options`/CSP/CORS headers, and so forth).
* Configured with an appcache manifest to allow a mobile
  browser to access content offline.
* Blocking third-party tracking services without requiring browser
  configuration.
* Allowing anyone to localize any website without needing
  to ask for permission.
* Creating "standalone" X-ray Goggles remixes.
* Throttling (e.g. for net neutrality simulation)
* Making browsing collaborative, e.g. using TogetherJS
* Doing things that addons or bookmarklets normally do, but on
  the proxy-side, e.g.
  * parental controls
  * content filtering
  * adding webmaker "hooks" to e.g. every image
  * presenting page assets in a completely different way

* The [Webmaker Field Research Report - Bangladesh][bangladesh]
  mentions that data is slow and costs lots of money, so most
  people either use the apps that came preloaded with their
  phones, or they manually transfer them from their friends'
  storage devices.
* Lots of anecdotal evidence from Hive organizations that need to
  hold events in places with spotty or nonexistent wi-fi.

## Environment Variables

**Note:** When an environment variable is described as representing a
boolean value, if the variable exists with *any* value (even the empty
string), the boolean is true; otherwise, it's false.

* `DEBUG` represents a boolean value. Setting this to true makes the server
  always regenerate bundled source code every request, among other things.

* `PORT` is the port that the server binds to. Defaults to 3000.

* `USERPASS` is an optional setting of the form *username:password*. If
  set, the entire server is protected by HTTP Basic Authentication
  and requires the given username and password to access.
